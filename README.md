Openni2-DepthSenseDriver
========================

- This is the OpenNI 2 driver for SoftKinetic sensor devices (e.g. DS325).

- Tested with OpenNI 2.2.0.30 (http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/).

- Requires DepthSensor SDK (http://www.softkinetic.com/en-us/support/download.aspx) to build.

- Still in the experimental stage. It just runs, but may have a lack of features or may be buggy.

- Does not run with NiTE. NiTE requires proprietary driver parameters that we cannot implement.
