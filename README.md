Openni2-DepthSenseDriver
========================

- This is OpenNI 2 driver to use SoftKinetic devices through DepthSensor SDK.

- This driver is still in the experimental stage. It just runs, but may have a lack of features or may be buggy.

- It does not run with NiTE because NiTE requires proprietary driver parameters.
